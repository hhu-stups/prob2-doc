== Building

Assuming you have all necessary dependencies installed (see below), run:

[source,sh]
----
$ make
----

The documentation will be built in HTML and PDF format and output into the build directory.

== Dependencies

The build requires https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] with the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-bibtex[BibTeX], https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[diagram], and https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/[PDF] extensions.
These dependencies are available in most package managers
and as a Docker image https://github.com/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor].

You can also use an existing https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby] installation and https://bundler.io/[Bundler] to install the dependencies:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
$ bundle install
----

Then use `bundle exec make` to run the build.
