= Installation

You can use the ProB 2.0 archive.
The easiest way is to use Gradle or Maven.

The artifact is providaed via http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22de.prob2.kernel%22[Maven central]
The current developer Snapshot can be found in the https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/de/hhu/stups/[Sonatype repository]

The following listing shows an example Gradle build script that can be used as a template for builds. We have also prepared an https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2_tooling_template[example project] that can be used as a template for a tool built on top of ProB 2.0.
