= Co-Simulation

ProB 2.0 contains some classes for cosimulating discrete models specified in one of the formalisms that are supported by ProB, and continuous models that are implemented using the https://fmi-standard.org/[functional mockup interface] standard. A so called functional mockup unit (FMU) can, for example, be created in C using the FMI SDK or exported from third party tools such as Dymola. The framework is built on top of https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/java/jfmi//[JFMI] from the Ptolemy Project. In fact, we only added a thin wrapper on top of the JFMI library.
The `de.prob.cosimulation.FMU` class can be used to load a .fmu file and to control the continuous part of the simulation.
