= Introduction

For developers who want to build specialized tools on top of ProB, we
have prepared comprehensive documentation of the ProB Java API together
with a template that enables a quick start. The documentation is
available in https://www3.hhu.de/stups/handbook/prob2/prob_user_manual.html[the user manual],
the template is located at https://github.com/bendisposto/prob2_tooling_template.

== About ProB 2.0

We believe that any proof centric formal method must
be complemented by animation and visualization to be
useful because there are always properties of a model
that cannot be covered by proof. In particular, a
proof can guarantee that a model is internally
consistent, but it cannot guarantee that this model
is actually what its designer had in mind. Animation
and visualization can help to review models.

ProB is a mature toolset that supports a whole range
of different formalisms such as classical B, Event-B,
CSP and Z. Previously, we developed a ProB plug-in
to add animation and model checking to the Rodin
platform. This plug-in was designed to be extensible
using an abstraction called a command. A command
encapsulates a call to the ProB CLI that is written
in the Prolog language and the result of that call.
The architecture was successfully used to build
third-party tools on top of ProB. For instance,
the UML-B Statechart animation plug-in uses ProB.

However, while the design was very flexible there were
some abstractions that were missing.
For instance, the API had no notion of a state space
or a trace through the state space. Each tool that
required one of these concepts had to reinvent them.
Also, building tools on top of ProB was a task for a
plug-in developer and it required a good deal of
effort, i.e., one needs to know how to create an
Eclipse plug-in. We wanted to introduce a more
lightweight approach to allow an end user to customize
the tool itself. In ProB 2.0 this can be done using
Groovy as an embedded scripting language. Our  major
design principles for the new version of ProB were:


* *Embrace Groovy* We try to make (almost) everything
accessible to the scripting language. This is very
important because it enables customization and extension
of the tool from within the tool. Actually we even
tried to go further by designing the tool as if it were
a library for Groovy. This made a couple of extensions
to ProB extremely easy. For instance, adding CSP support
to the plug-in only took a few hours.
* *Add recurring abstractions:* We have identified three
main abstractions: model, state space and trace.
The state space contains two further abstractions:
a state and a transition. The model represents the
static properties of a specification, i.e., its abstract
syntax. For Event-B this could have been done using the
Rodin abstractions, but we wanted to use Event-B and
classical B uniformly. A trace consists of a list of
transitions that have been executed in order.
* *Prefer immutability:* This is more a implementation
principle than a design principle but we think it is
essential to prefer immutable objects wherever it is
possible. If we add a new step to a trace, we do not
change the trace but we generate a new trace.
Because of the consistent use of immutable values,
we can use structural sharing to avoid expensive
copying.
