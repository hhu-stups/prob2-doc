We assume that you have grasped the way that ProB setups up the initial
states of a B machine as outlined in
link:/Tutorial_Setup_Phases[Tutorial Setup Phases], and have understood
why animation is difficult as outlined in
link:/Tutorial_Understanding_the_Complexity_of_B_Animation[Tutorial
Understanding the Complexity of B Animation]. You may also want to have
a look at the explanation of
link:/Well-Definedness_Checking[well-definedness in B].

[[a-simple-example]]
A simple example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us use the following B machine as starting point:

....
MACHINE WhileLoopInvariantError
VARIABLES xx
INVARIANT
 xx:NATURAL
INITIALISATION xx:=1
OPERATIONS
  Set(c) = PRE c:1..10 & xx<=c THEN
    WHILE xx < c DO xx := xx+1
    INVARIANT
      xx <= c & xx:NATURAL &
      xx<10 /* this is wrong */
    VARIANT c-xx
    END
  END;
  r <-- Get = BEGIN r:= xx END
END
....

After loading and initialising the machine you see that ProB has found a
so-called ``transition error'', i.e., an error that occured while
computing enabled operations (which correspond to a transition from one
state to the B machine to another). These errors are displayed in red in
the State Properties pane:

When you click on the red transition error you get presented with more
details about the error:

 image::ProB_WhileAfterErrClick.png[]

Sometimes you can also have the possibility to click on a ``Visualise''
button, which in this case will give you a graphical visualisation of
the invariant violation:

The same technique applies for inspecting other transition errors, such
as:

* link:/Well-Definedness_Checking[well-definedness errors] of
expressions such as:
** arithmetic well-definedness errors (division by 0, modulo by 0,
modulo for negative numbers, min or max of empty set)
** functional well-definedness errors (function applied outside of
domain or applied to relation,...)
** sequence well-definedness errors (first, last, tail, front of empt
sequence,...)
* PRE condition errors (not for outermost preconditions, which are
treated specially)
* ASSERT condition violations
